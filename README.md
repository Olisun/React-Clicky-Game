## About the project:
We have to create a React Memory Game with click functions and methods to track current score and high score.

## User Guide:


## MVP Objectives:

  * The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

  * The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

  * Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

  * Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

## Stretch Goals:

  
## Techology Stack:
  * React
  * React-BootStrap
  * Create-React-App
